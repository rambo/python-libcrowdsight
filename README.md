# CrowdSight bindings for Python

An attempt at it anyway. <http://sightcorp.com/crowdsight/>

Using SIP (not the VOIP protocol): <https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/sip/intro> because it seemed like the sanest way to handle the mapping.

OpenCV unfortunately uses completely home-grown bindings-generation
so their source doesn't help me here.
